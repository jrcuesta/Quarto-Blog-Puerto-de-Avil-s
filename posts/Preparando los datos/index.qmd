First we load the libraries we need to read the data and make some plots.

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

```

We prepare the data to be read in R (from an Excel file in Github). 

```{r}
url <- "https://github.com/jrcuesta/Puerto-de-Aviles/raw/refs/heads/main/puerto_aviles_16.xls"

# Create a tempora
temp_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".xls")

# Download the file
download.file(url, temp_file, mode = "wb")  # "wb" is important for binary files

# read the file in R
df <- read_excel(temp_file)

# See the header
head(df)
```
